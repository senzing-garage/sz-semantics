# sz_semantics

Transform JSON output from the [Senzing SDK](https://senzing.com/docs/python/)
for use with graph technologies, semantics, and downstream LLM integration.


## Install

This library uses [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for
demos:

```bash
poetry update
```

Otherwise, to use the library:

```bash
pip install sz_sematics
```

For the [gRCP server](https://github.com/senzing-garage/serve-grpc), 
if you don't already have Senzing and its gRPC server otherwise
installed pull the latest Docker container:

```bash
docker pull senzing/serve-grpc:latest
```


## Usage: Masking PII

Mask the PII values within Senzing JSON output with tokens which can
be substituted back later. For example, _mask_ PII values before
calling a remote service (such as an LLM-based chat) then _unmask_
returned text after the roundtrip, to maintain _data privacy_.

```python
import json
from sz_semantics import Mask

data: dict = { "ENTITY_NAME": "Robert Smith" }

sz_mask: Mask = Mask()
masked_data: dict = sz_mask.mask_data(data)

masked_text: str = json.dumps(masked_data)
print(masked_text)

unmasked: str = sz_mask.unmask_text(masked_text)
print(unmasked)
```

For an example, run the `demo1.py` script with a data file which
captures Senzing JSON output:

```bash
poetry run python3 demo1.py data/get.json
```

The two lists `Mask.KNOWN_KEYS` and `Mask.MASKED_KEYS` enumerate
respectively the:

  * keys for known elements which do not require masking
  * keys for PII elements which require masking

Any other keys encountered will be masked by default and reported as
warnings in the logging. Adjust these lists as needed for a given use
case.

For work with large numbers of entities, subclass `KeyValueStore` to
provide a distributed key/value store (other than the Python built-in
`dict` default) to use for scale-out.


## Usage: Semantic Represenation

Starting with a small [SKOS-based taxonomy](https://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/)
in the `domain.ttl` file, parse the Senzing
[_entity resolution_](https://senzing.com/what-is-entity-resolution/)
(ER) results to generate an 
[`RDFlib`](https://rdflib.readthedocs.io/) _semantic graph_
then transform this into a 
[`NetworkX`](https://networkx.org/) _property graph_, which represents a 
[_semantic layer_](https://enterprise-knowledge.com/what-is-a-semantic-layer-components-and-enterprise-applications/).
In other words, generate the "backbone" for constructing an
[_Entity Resolved Knowledge Graph_](https://senzing.com/entity-resolved-knowledge-graphs/).

```python
import pathlib
from sz_semantics import Thesaurus

thes: Thesaurus = Thesaurus()

thes.parse_er_export(
    [
        "data/truth/customers.json",
        "data/truth/reference.json",
        "data/truth/watchlist.json",
    ],
    export_path = pathlib.Path("data/truth/export.json"),
    er_path = pathlib.Path("thesaurus.ttl"),
)

thes.load_er_thesaurus(
    er_path = pathlib.Path("thesaurus.ttl"),
)

thes.save_sem_layer(pathlib.Path("sem.json"))
```

For an example, run the `demo2.py` script to process the JSON file
`data/export.json` which captures Senzing ER exported results:

```bash
poetry run python3 demo2.py
```

Check the generated RDF in `thesaurus.ttl` and the resulting property
graph in the `sem.json` node-link format file.

**Note:** this portion is a work-in-progress, currently refactoring
toward a more scalable approach for streaming updates.


## Usage: gRPC Client/Server

For a demo of `SzClient` to simplify accessing the Senzing SDK via a
gRPC server, then running _entity resolution_ on the "truthset"
collection of sample datasets, first launch this container and have it
running in the background:

```bash
docker run -it --publish 8261:8261 --rm senzing/serve-grpc
```

Then run:

```bash
poetry run python3 demo3.py
```

Restart the container each time before re-running the `demo3.py`
script.
