# sz_semantics

Transform JSON output from the [Senzing SDK](https://senzing.com/docs/python/)
for use with graph technologies, semantics, and downstream LLM integration.


## Install

This library uses [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for
demos:

```bash
poetry update
```

Otherwise, to use the library:

```bash
pip install sz_sematics
```

For the [gRCP server](https://github.com/senzing-garage/serve-grpc), 
if you don't already have Senzing and its gRPC server otherwise
installed pull the latest Docker container:

```bash
docker pull senzing/serve-grpc:latest
```


## Usage: Masking PII

Mask the PII values within Senzing JSON output with tokens which can
be substituted back later. For example, _mask_ PII values before
calling a remote service (such as an LLM-based chat) then _unmask_
returned text after the roundtrip, to maintain _data privacy_.

```python
import json
from sz_semantics import Mask

data: dict = { "ENTITY_NAME": "Robert Smith" }

sz_mask: Mask = Mask()
masked_data: dict = sz_mask.mask_data(data)

masked_text: str = json.dumps(masked_data)
print(masked_text)

unmasked: str = sz_mask.unmask_text(masked_text)
print(unmasked)
```

For an example, run the `demo1.py` script with a data file which
captures Senzing JSON output:

```bash
poetry run python3 demo1.py data/get.json
```

The two lists `Mask.KNOWN_KEYS` and `Mask.MASKED_KEYS` enumerate
respectively the:

  * keys for known elements which do not require masking
  * keys for PII elements which require masking

Any other keys encountered will be masked by default and reported as
warnings in the logging. Adjust these lists as needed for a given use
case.

For work with large numbers of entities, subclass `KeyValueStore` to
provide a distributed key/value store (other than the Python built-in
`dict` default) to use for scale-out.


## Usage: Semantic Represenation

Starting with a small [SKOS-based taxonomy](https://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/)
in the `domain.ttl` file, parse the Senzing
[_entity resolution_](https://senzing.com/what-is-entity-resolution/)
(ER) results to generate an 
[`RDFlib`](https://rdflib.readthedocs.io/) _semantic graph_.

In other words, generate the "backbone" for constructing an
[_Entity Resolved Knowledge Graph_](https://senzing.com/entity-resolved-knowledge-graphs/),
as a core componet of a
[_semantic layer_](https://enterprise-knowledge.com/what-is-a-semantic-layer-components-and-enterprise-applications/).

The example code below serializes the _thesaurus_ generated from
Senzing ER results as `"the.ttl"` then this combined with the Senzing
_taxonomy_ definitions as `"sem.ttl"` -- where the latter would be
used for construction knowledge graphs:


```python
import pathlib
from sz_semantics import Thesaurus

thesaurus: Thesaurus = Thesaurus()
thesaurus.load_source(Thesaurus.DOMAIN_TTL) # "domain.ttl"

thesaurus_path: pathlib.Path = pathlib.Path("the.ttl")
sem_layer_path: pathlib.Path = pathlib.Path("sem.ttl")

fp_rdf: io.TextIOWrapper = thesaurus_path.open("w", encoding = "utf-8")
fp_rdf.write(Thesaurus.RDF_PREAMBLE)

export_path: pathlib.Path = pathlib.Path("data/truth/export.json")

with open(export_path, "r", encoding = "utf-8") as fp_json:
    for line in fp_json:
        for rdf_frag in thesaurus.parse_iter(line, language = "en"):
            fp_rdf.write(rdf_frag)
            fp_rdf.write("\n")

thesaurus.load_source(thesaurus_path, format = "turtle")
thesaurus.save_source(sem_layer_path, format = "turtle")
```

For an example, run the `demo2.py` script to process the JSON file
`data/export.json` which captures Senzing ER exported results:

```bash
poetry run python3 demo2.py
```

Then check the RDF definitions in the generated `sem.ttl` file.


## Usage: gRPC Client/Server

For a demo of `SzClient` to simplify accessing the Senzing SDK via a
gRPC server, then running _entity resolution_ on the "truthset"
collection of sample datasets, first launch this container and have it
running in the background:

```bash
docker run -it --publish 8261:8261 --rm senzing/serve-grpc
```

Then run:

```bash
poetry run python3 demo3.py
```

Restart the container each time before re-running the `demo3.py`
script.
